# Egen_data_engineering


#### This Project was developed to complete an End-to-End Data Engineering using Docker, Apache Airflow, Python and PostGres Database.
1. First scan through COVID Data Sources from a JSON file which consists of other data sources.
2. Extract the URL which can help to download the Data.
3. Download the Data from the URLS and save it in a PostGres Database for future Analysis.
4. Schedule this Job to run everyday using Apache Airflow.


### 1. Scan through COVID Data Sources in a JSON File.
#### 1. I used Jupyter Notebook to develop a Python Script to extract URL's which consists of Data Sources with COVID-19 Datasets.
#### 2. Below is an example of the JSON Data which explains about the various Data Sources present in the Online API's.

  #### As the dataset is present in the above URL's given, we can iterate through this data and pick Keywords which consists of COVID-19, CORONAVIRUS and Severe Acute Respiratory disease as their respective keywords.

  #### After this, I extracted the URLS for every data source which consists these above Keywords.

  #### Now, after writing a function to download the Data in my local machine, I saved the Data in this manner.

  #### Since the basic funtioning of my Data Extraction was ready, I deployed the Data in my PostGres Database using this function.
